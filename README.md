# 🧪 Chemistry Virtual Lab – Determination of pI of Glycine

An interactive **web-based chemistry virtual laboratory** that simulates the **potentiometric titration method for determining the isoelectric point (pI) of glycine**. The project is built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** and focuses on providing a realistic, guided lab experience through visual interaction.

---

## 🔬 Project Overview

This virtual lab allows users to perform a simulated titration experiment by:

* Setting up laboratory apparatus using **drag-and-drop**
* Following **step-by-step guided instructions**
* Observing real-time **pH changes** during titration
* Recording titration data and visualizing it graphically
* Automatically calculating **pKa₁, pKa₂, and the isoelectric point (pI)** of glycine

The UI is designed to resemble an actual chemistry lab bench, making the experiment intuitive and visually clear.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project Locally

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Open the project folder in **VS Code** (recommended).

3. Run the project using one of the following:

   * Open `index.html` with **Live Server** (recommended)
   * Or open `index.html` directly in a browser

> ⚠️ Using Live Server ensures correct asset loading and smoother interaction.

## 🧪 Experiment Workflow

1. Start the experiment from the landing page
2. Place apparatus in the correct order using drag-and-drop
3. Add reagents as instructed
4. Perform titration by adding NaOH incrementally
5. Observe pH changes and data logging
6. View the generated graph and final calculated pI
